You are a research assistant helping to prepare a comprehensive lecture on the following topic:

TOPIC: {topic}

{revision_section}

IMPORTANT: If there is revision feedback above, you MUST incorporate it into your plan. The human reviewer's feedback is critical and must be addressed in your search queries and research angles.

Create a detailed research action plan that outlines HOW you will conduct the research. This plan will be reviewed by a human before any searches are executed.

Your plan should include:

1. SEARCH QUERIES (5-7 specific queries):
   - Queries that will find authoritative sources
   - Cover different aspects of the topic
   - Include academic, news, and industry perspectives

2. RESEARCH ANGLES (4-6 angles to explore):
   - Each angle should be a specific aspect or perspective to investigate
   - Explain why this angle is important for the topic
   - These angles will guide how the research findings are organized

Format your response as JSON:
{{
    "search_queries": [
        "query 1",
        "query 2",
        ...
    ],
    "research_angles": [
        {{
            "title": "Angle Title",
            "description": "Brief explanation of what this angle covers and why it matters"
        }},
        ...
    ]
}}
